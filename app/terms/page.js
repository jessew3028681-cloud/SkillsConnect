            <p>
              SkillsConnect Ghana is a digital intermediary marketplace that allows customers (individuals seeking service) to locate, communicate with, and submit service enquiries to verified independent service providers (artisans, such as plumbers, electricians, carpenters, etc.).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Please Note:</strong> SkillsConnect Ghana is not an employer, general contractor, or agent of any artisan. All service agreements, project pricing, timelines, payment schedules, and actual craft deliverables are negotiated and entered into directly between the customer and the artisan. We do not guarantee or supervise artisan performance or accept liability for any project outcomes.
